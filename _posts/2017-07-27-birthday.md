Marian is my best friend in New Zealand. She prepared a cake and an UM training T-shirt for me today as the gift. You know, I am not the guy who will tell others the date of my birthday, but two weeks ago, Marian asked me about it and I told her.  
  
To my surprise, she noted it down and sent me "Happy Birthday ...." this morning. I was so happy because it comes from my friend. However, she told me that she also prepared some gifts for me. Wow, though I don't know what kind of gift I will receive, I know I will love it for sure.

As you see, this is a homemade cake, which is the first homemade present I receive in my life. It's so wonderful and amazing. And I proposed that we should take the selfie. Then I have this photo, the one, both of us like very much.
