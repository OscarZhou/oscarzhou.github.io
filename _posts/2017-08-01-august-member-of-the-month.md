Today, I hit the gym as usual. When I walked into the building, Massey Recreation, I was stunned. Because I saw the posters showed below everywhere in the gym. 

This is the first time I feel like I am a star. Many of my friends sent me messages to say congrats! The point is that you can see the reviews written by the staffs at the bottom of the poster. Honestly, I don't even know I am as good as they wrote, but I believe that it is true. Hah. Also it is the motivation for me to train harder in the future.

I have been working out in Massey Recreation for one year, which is the same time I stay in New Zealand. I dreamt of being chosen to be the member of the month many times before, but I never think it will become the true. I think I am a lucky guy. Thank you for giving me so big surprise!
