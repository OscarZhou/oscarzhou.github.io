This photo is taken at Whakapapa ski resort. Skiing is not strange to me, because my hometown is located in the northeast of China where snows a lot every winter, so I got a lot of opportunities to ski. However, I only ski twice times before. Although it's not too many, I can play it well in an intermediate ski slopes.

This is my first time to try snowboarding, I hardly imagine that I can manage it after basic coaching class. I have to say I am a natural athlete. Hah. Because in my opinion, snowboarding is much more difficult than skiing. And the point is that the latest skiing is five years ago.  
  
I think I have been fallen love with snowboarding. Even now, five hours later, I still want to snowboard again. Unfortunately, I am already on the way back to Auckland. See you next year!
