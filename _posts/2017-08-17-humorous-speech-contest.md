Tonight is really fabulous. I delivered a humorous speech in front of nearly 30 audiences.

To be honest, one year ago, I did not ever imagine that I will participate the humorous contest one year later. At that moment, I just joined the Sunnynook Toastmaster Club for 2 or 4 weeks and my role was the time keeper. When I watched the performance of those contestants, I was thinking "Wow, they are so excellent!". But at that time, I never think that I will stand on that stage one day.

I am so grateful to Sharon, who is the DTM in our club, for giving me the chance to participate this contest. I was delighted that my speech made audiences laugh.

In addition, I controlled the speed of the speaking, which is the first time in my five speeches. I delivered with the pause and vocal variety. I really can feel the progress I had made in the past one year.

Although I only obtain the participation award, I am still very happy, as I know that my competitor is not others but myself. Participation is already victory for me.
