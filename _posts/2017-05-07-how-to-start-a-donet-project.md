Many junior developers always meet such situation that they don't know where to start their projects once the requirement document was given. In this article, I will introduce you several steps to help you start the project in a reasonable sequence. I will take a .Net project as an example.

I will list the sequence firstly, and then explain them one by on specifically.

##### [1. **Extract the user case from the document**](#1)

##### [2. **Find depedencies among these user case in order to that we can determine the orders to implement**](#2)

##### [3. **Determine the core user case**](#3)

##### [4. **Drag the core user case to sprint**](#4)

##### [5. **Change the order in curret sprint**](#5)

Before we start, we should have had the following tools and accounts:
1. **Visual Studio IDE** 
2. **Visual Studio Account**

Okay, let's start the project. For example, we have the requirement shown below.


<h3 id="1">**Extract the user case from the document**</h3>
<h3 id="2">**Find depedencies among these user case in order to that we can determine the orders to implement**</h3>
<h3 id="3">**Determine the core user case**</h3>
<h3 id="4">**Drag the core user case to sprint**</h3>
<h3 id="5">**Change the order in curret sprint**</h3>
