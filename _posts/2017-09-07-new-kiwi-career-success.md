Today is the last day to study some knowledge in job application in New Kiwi Career Success. It's really a useful and valuable course for people who are from other countries.

I feel very lucky that I can attend this course. I studied a lot from two intelligent ladies, Annette and Leah. And I also met so many awesome friends.
