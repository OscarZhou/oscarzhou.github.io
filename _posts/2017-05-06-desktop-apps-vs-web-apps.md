## Introduction 

There are lots of apps floating around in the world today. Desktop applications are installed on a personal or work computer desktop. Web applications can be accessed through the Internet (or through an Intranet). While both types of applications are software-based, there are fundamental difference between desktop and web applications.  

Some people argue that web applications are superior for various reasons. Other people argue that desktop applications will always reign supreme. A number of people use both types of applications. The truth is that both web apps and desktop apps have their place within the app world. The trick is knowing when to use one type of program versus the other.

            Web based applications need to be <span style='color:red'>installed</span> only once whereas desktop applications are to be installed separately on each computer. Also <span style='color:red'>updating</span> the applications is cumbersome with desktop applications as it needs to be done on every single computer which is not the case with web applications.

            Desktop applications are confined to a <span style='color:red'>physical location</span> and hence have usability constraint. Web applications development on the other hand makes it convenient for the users to access the application from <span style='color:red'>any location</span> using the Internet.

            Web application development relies significantly on <span style='color:red'>Internet connectivity</span> and speed. Absence of Internet or its poor connectivity can cause performance issues with web applications. Desktop applications are <span style='color:red'>standalone</span> in nature and hence do not face any hindrances resulting from Internet connectivity.
