Yesterday, Dillon invited me to go hiking with his friends. However, he did not tell me that today is his 26th birthday and I did not realized that as well. Anyway happy birthday Dillon! This is my first time to participate the Kiwi style birthday party, but Dillon told me that it is kind of like a typical 5 years old kid's birthday. Hah, it is quite interesting.

Our destination is Arataki which is in the west of Auckland. The view is really awesome but it is a little bit code.

I really love this picture taken in the Arataki Visitor Center because you can see my eyes and my smile at the same time. Lol, it is not common to happen.

Go hiking is one of my favorite sports. You can walk to see the scenery and sometimes you probably meet others and talk with them along the way. Two Columbia ladies are very friendly and outgoing. I was very happy to talk with them. By the way, they are really good dancer.

It was so nice to meet so many new friends. Even though it rained all the time, everyone enjoyed this trip.
