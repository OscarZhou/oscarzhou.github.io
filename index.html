			This is a private winform application based on .Net Framework and supported by SQL Server database.

So far, the latest version is v1.7.0, My plan for the next version is to add data analysis to this project and integrate products' price on manufactures' websites to my application via web scraping. <a href="/project/omt.html"> [Read more]</a>
